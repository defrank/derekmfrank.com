### Description
This is the old site code for derekmfrank.com, which was my personal website to host my portfolio, blog,
about me, and other information.  A task I began to delve into web development.
Achieved a good understanding of the technologies used.  SQLite3 was neglected due to Django's ORM,
but was an ideal choice for this project and made for a easily portable database.

### Implementation
* **Stack:** Apache2, Python2.6/Django1.5, SQLite3, HTML5, CSS3
* **Web Host:** [Dreamhost](https://dreamhost.com/) via Shared Hosting and Passenger FastCGI
